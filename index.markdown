# Identifying the problem
We noticed the problem upon a combination of market research, feedback of the customers from various stores, and personal observation. In the initial phase, a series of questionnaires for frequent shoppers highlighted the frustration with managing multiple loyalty applications. 
By observing the market, we further confirmed that the average smartphone user is increasingly concerned about the number of apps they manage, and clutter is a growing problem.

The increase in the number of apps has caused many people to feel exasperated, which describes the concept of [App Fatigue](https://www.storyly.io/post/too-many-apps-for-that-app-fatigue). Moreover, [it only takes a week](https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/most-apps-get-deleted-within-a-week) for the average smartphone user to delete an app. At the same time, [30% of app downloads in North America—as measured by Tune’s customers between November 2017 and May 2018—were reinstalls](https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/smartphone-users-are-reinstalling-apps-at-a-surprisingly-high-rate).

Looking into the Romanian market of applications, we found multiple platforms for  retailer chains, fast-food stores, and even jewelry shops.

Moreover, certain platforms, such as Starbucks, only offer a web-like layout, which is not optimized for mobile devices. What is more, it requires the user to log in every time they want to access the platform.

While preinstalled solutions, such as Apple Wallet, include multiple cards, it is not possible to see the points balance or redeem rewards.

# How to beat app fatigue
The solution envisioned is PunctConnect, an app designed to consolidate various loyalty programs into one platform. By offering a centralized loyalty program management system, PunctConnect aims to reduce app clutter, save phone storage space, and simplify the user experience.

# Customer discovery
The customer discovery plan includes conducting surveys with numerous participants who frequently use loyalty programs. The goal is to understand their habits, preferences, and pain points. The survey will be conducted online, in a Google Form, and the participants will be recruited through social media. 
dentifying Customer Segments

* Behaviors: Focus on those who actively participate in loyalty programs and have expressed frustration with the current system.
